Overview

Description
===========

TDE is a simple, public domain, multi-file/multi-window binary and text
file editor written for IBM PCs and close compatibles running either
DOS, Windows or Linux.  TDE is suitable for editing batch files, binary
files, text files, and various computer language source code files.
The only limit on the number and size of files that TDE can handle is
the amount of memory.  Likewise, the only limit on the number of
windows is the amount of memory.  There is no preset maximum number of
files or windows that may be open at any one time.

Introduction
============

I (Frank Davis) work with data files, computer source code, and various
text files quite a bit.  Most of the features in TDE are related, in
some way, to handling those types of files.  The various window and
cursor commands in TDE are really nice for comparing and editing source
code or output files.  A good collection of block commands is available
for use on source code and formatted data files.  For what little word
processing I do, TDE has a few simple commands for formatting text and
paragraphs.  In short, TDE contains most of the features that I use
most of the time in an easy to use, easy to remember, and easy to
configure editor.  I hope you find TDE as easy to use for most of your
routine editing as me.

Usage
*****

The general format for running TDE is:

     tde [-v] [-i CONFIG] [-w [WORKSPACE]]
         [options] [filename(s)] [options] [-f|F|g|G[=] PATTERN filename(s)]

Everything is optional -- running without any parameters will either
bring up a prompt to load a filename (or display the directory list for
a pattern), or automatically load the workspace if `tde.wsp' is present
in the current directory (`.tdewsp' in UNIX).  The three options `-v',
`-i' and `-w' must be first, but can appear in any order amongst
themselves.

`-v'
     Enter viewer mode, where every file is loaded read-only.

`-i'
     Read the specified configuration file (after reading the global
     and local files; *note Configuration::).

`-w'
     If this is used by itself, TDE will load the workspace from its
     home directory; if it doesn't exist the usual prompt is displayed.
     If WORKSPACE is present, but no other options, TDE will load the
     given workspace.  When used with other options, TDE will load as
     normal, using WORKSPACE as the filename of the workspace.

`-f'
`-F'
`-g'
`-G'
     These options cause TDE to search files for PATTERN.  The lower
     case letter will ignore case, whilst the upper case letter will
     match it.  `F' will perform a text-based search; `G' will perform
     a regular expression search.  The normal operation is to load the
     first matching file, positioned at the first match; adding `='
     immediately after the letter will instead create a window
     containing the matching lines from all files.  If a directory is
     specified all files in that directory will be searched.


   Filenames (and directories) can include wildcards (*note DirList::,
*note DefineGrep::).  If a directory is specified, the directory list
will be brought up for it.

   Options begin with either `-' or `+'.  An option starting with `-'
will apply to all following files; an option starting with `+' will
apply to only one file.  A lower case option letter will apply to the
file(s) coming after it; an upper case letter will apply to the file
before it (and possibly those after it).  For options that apply to
following files, the normal behavior can be restored by adding `-'
after the letter.

`a'
     Usually files are only loaded into the editor at the request of
     the user (by closing the current file or explicitly loading the
     next); this option will load all files into the editor immediately.

`b[N]'
`b!'
     Load files as binary, using N as the line length (default is 64);
     if N is zero, force loading files as text; if N is negative, load
     text files as normal and use the positive value of N as the line
     length for binary files (without prompting).  Alternatively, skip
     binary files altogether.

`c TITLE'
     Name the window TITLE; use `.' for the filename (which won't be
     split like it usually is).  This option always applies to only one
     file.

`e MACRO'
     Execute MACRO after loading each file.  If MACRO refers to an
     existing file, it will be read as a macro file.

`l[LANG]'
     If LANG is absent, syntax highlighting will be disabled; otherwise
     it will be used as the language, overriding the filename test.

`n'
     Create a new (scratch) window.

`r'
     Load files as read-only.

`s'
     Set the scratch flag for files.

`t[N]'
     Use a physical tab size of N (default is 8; 0 will deflate tabs).

`[LINE][:COL]'
     Start at the specified position.  If LINE is negative it will be
     taken from the end of the file (i.e. `-1' is the last line, `-2'
     is the second last, etc.).  If COL is negative it will be taken
     from the end of the line (i.e. `0' is EOL, `-1' is the last
     character, `-2' is the second last, etc.).  This option always
     applies to only one file -- start with `+' for the next file, `-'
     for the previous (sic).

`+OFFSET'
     Move to the specified offset (prefix with `0x' for hexadecimal) in
     the file.  It can be used with text files, but OFFSET is not the
     same as the file offset, since line endings are not counted.  This
     option always applies to only one file, as above.


   There are also a number of help options.  These options must be the
only argument present.

`/?'
`-?'
`--help'
     Display a (long) help screen, including version and contact
     information.

`--version'
     Just display the current version and release date.

`-g?'
`-G?'
     Display the regular expression help screen.

`-??'
     Display the wildcard help screen.


   Finally, TDE can be used as a filter, where it reads from standard
input and writes to standard output.  In this instance, input is
treated as an implicit (scratch) file after the command, so it is
always read first and the upper case version of options is required.

Examples
========

     tde -b FILE1 -b- FILE2
     tde FILE1 +B FILE2

   Both load FILE1 as binary (using the default line length of 64) and
auto-detect the type of FILE2.

     dir | tde >dir.lst

   Pipe the output of `dir' into TDE and save its output into `dir.lst'.

     unzip -c tde51ss | tdv -Lc

   View TDE's source using C syntax highlighting (`tdv' is equivalent
to `tde -v').

     tde -lpascal file.c file.bat -l file.for -l- file.cbl

   This will load `file.c' and `file.bat' using Pascal syntax
highlighting, disable syntax highlighting for `file.for' and use the
filename to determine if `file.cbl' should have it.

     tdv -b! ...

   View every text file in the current directory and all subdirectories.

     tde -F s_output .;[dwu]*/*.[ch]

   Do a case-sensitive, text-based search for `s_output', in all the
`.c' and `.h' files in the current directory and the subdirectories
starting with `d', `w' and `u'.  UNIX users can use `:' instead of `;'.

     tde -e "JumpToPosition \"-1:0\" Rturn LineDown BottomLine LineUp" FILE

   Load FILE, moving to EOL of the last line, with EOF at the bottom of
the window.

Configuration
*************

TDE uses three external files: `tde.cfg', `tde.hlp' and `tde.shl' (in
UNIX the dot is at the front).  These files are read from the home
directory (the "global" file) and/or the current directory (the "local"
file).  The home directory is determined by the environment variables
`TDEHOME' or `HOME', or the same path as TDE itself, whichever exists
first (however, in order for `HOME' to be used in DOS or Windows,
`tde.cfg' must already exist in it).  The default `tde.cfg' and
`tde.hlp' files can be found in the `config' directory (without any dot
for UNIX); the default `tde.shl' is called `tdedist.shl' in the source
distribution (its `tde.shl' includes TDE's own highlighting).

`tde.cfg'
     This file defines what key performs what function (including
     macros) and the initial state of the editor (mode settings and
     colors).  It can also define upper and lower case letters and the
     sort sequence.  Please see the default file for more information.
     It is loaded globally first and then locally (i.e. both locations,
     not one or the other).

`tde.hlp'
     This file contains the screen(s) displayed when *Note Help:: is
     pressed.  It is at most 50 lines, with at most 100 characters per
     line; any more than this will be ignored.  Lines need not be the
     same length, as all lines will be space-padded to the length of
     the longest.  Two screens are present, one for the normal help and
     another for read-only files; separate the two with a `<<<>>>'
     sequence.  If `tde.hlp' doesn't exist locally it will be read
     globally.  A local file need only define one type of screen; the
     other will still be read globally.

`tde.shl'
     This file supplies the colors used for syntax highlighting and the
     information required to assign those colors to a particular file.
     It searches for the language locally first and then tries
     globally.  Note that when a local language is found, all the
     patterns are prefixed with the current directory.


Syntax Highlighting
===================

The colors always come first in the file.  They are global for all
languages.  Colors are defined in the same manner as in the
configuration file (see `config/tde.cfg').  Following are all the
recognized colors, with their default color in brackets.

`background'
     The default background color for all the following (blue).

`normal'
     The color for any text that is not explicitly highlighted (yellow).

`bad'
     The color for invalid components, such as malformed numbers,
     character literals containing too many characters, or unterminated
     string and character literals (bright red).

`keyword'
     The color of keywords (white).

`comment'
     The color of comments (grey).

`function'
     The color of function names (bright green).

`string'
     The color of string literals (bright cyan).

`character'
     The color of character literals (bright cyan).

`integer'
     The color of numbers (in decimal, without a point; bright cyan).

`binary'
     The color of binary (base 2) numbers (bright cyan).

`octal'
     The color of octal (base 8) numbers (bright cyan).

`hex'
     The color of hexadecimal (base 16) numbers (bright cyan).

`real'
     The color of numbers with a decimal point (bright cyan).

`preprocessor'
     The color of preprocessor statements (cyan).

`symbol'
     The color of any non-alphanumeric that is otherwise unrecognized
     (white).


   The language definitions follow the colors.  Each definition is
started with `language' and continues until the next `language' or EOF.
The following keywords can be used to define a language (where `[]'
indicates an optional component and `|' indicates one or the other):

`language NAME [from] PARENT'
     Associates NAME with the syntax highlighting information.  This is
     what is used to select a particular syntax highlight (*note
     SyntaxSelect::).  If PARENT exists, this language will inherit all
     of PARENT's language definitions.

`pattern WILDCARDS'
     Must follow immediately after `language'.  It is a space-separated
     list of wildcards to identify a language from a file's extension
     (or name, or even path).

`case match | ignore'
     Determines if keywords will be case sensitive or insensitive.  The
     default is `match'.

`startword LIST'
`inword    LIST'
`innumber  LIST'
     A list (or range) of characters that may start a word (or, more
     correctly, an identifier), be found within a word and be found
     within numbers.

`comment STRING'
`comment STRING1 STRING2'
     Indicates STRING will begin a line comment (stops at the end of the
     line), or that STRING1 and STRING2 will begin and end a block
     comment (can extend across multiple lines).  Each string can be up
     to four characters and there can be two of each type of comment.

`function CHAR'
     Identifiers that are followed by CHAR (allowing for whitespace, but
     not across line boundaries) are given the `function' color.

`preprocessor CHAR2 [spanline CHAR]'
     Lines that begin with CHAR2 (one or two characters) are given the
     `preprocessor' color.  If the line ends in CHAR, the preprocessor
     will continue on the next line.

`binary CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
`octal  CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
`hex    CHAR2- | -CHAR2'
     Define the format of binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers.  The
     first form indicates a prefix (such as C's `0x123'), the second a
     suffix (such as assembly's `123h').

`string    C1 [C2]       [spanline CHAR] [newline]'
`character C1 [C2] [NUM] [spanline CHAR] [newline]'
     Define the starting and closing characters of string and character
     literals.  If C2 is missing, it is taken the same as C1.
     `spanline' indicates the literal will continue onto the next line
     if this line ends in CHAR; `newline' indicates that it will
     continue onto the next line, regardless.  NUM is the maximum
     number of characters permitted in a character literal.  The
     default is one; if it is zero, `character' functions identically
     to `string'.

`escape CHAR'
     When CHAR is encountered within a string or character literal, the
     following character is skipped over.

`keyword LIST'
     The words in LIST will be displayed in the `keyword' color.  Note
     that all of the color keywords can be used in this fashion (when
     LIST starts with a character from `startword').

`COLOR LIST'
     Use COLOR to display the words in LIST.

`InflateTabs'
`LTabSize'
`Macro'
`PseudoMacro'
`PTabSize'
`UserMenu'
     The same as the configuration file, although macros must be
     defined using a two-key combination.

Key:    `Alt+]'
Key:    `Ctrl+K Ctrl+K' (UNIX)
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to the end of the block.  For a box block, it will
move to the right edge first, then the left.  For a line block, the
column will be the same as when the block was marked.

BlockExpandTabs
===============

Key:    `Alt+E'
Menu:   Block > Expand Tabs

   Expand the tabs in the block to the appropriate number of spaces,
using the current physical tab size (*note SetTabs::).  This function
is only available for a line block.

BlockFixUUE
===========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+.'
Menu:   Block > Conversions > Fix UUE Prob

   Fixes the EBCDIC to ASCII problem with text e-mail.

BlockIndent
===========

Key:    `Ctrl+K Ctrl+I'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Indent

   Perform a tab (*note Tab::) on the first line of the block and add
the same number of spaces to the remaining lines.  The tab is added at
the first non-blank character and initial blank lines are skipped.  A
box block effectively treats the left edge as the beginning of the
line; this function is not available for a stream block.

BlockIndentN
============

Key:    `Ctrl+K I'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Indent spaces

   Ask for a number and add that many spaces to the beginning of the
block.  If the number is zero, the first line will be used to align the
remaining lines.  A box block effectively treats the left edge as the
beginning of the line; this function is not available for a stream
block.

BlockIndentTabs
===============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+I'
Menu:   Block > Indent Tabs

   Compress initial spaces in the line to tabs, leaving remaining
spaces alone.  This function is only available for line blocks.

BlockInvertCase
===============

Key:    `Ctrl+Alt+`'
Menu:   Block > Conversions > Invert Case

   Convert lower case characters in the block to upper case and vice
versa.

BlockLeftJustify
================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+F8'
Menu:   Word > (Block Justify) Left

   Left justify the contents of the block.  For a line block, each line
is adjusted to start at the left margin; for a box block, text within
the block is moved to the left edge of the block; a stream block will
generate a warning.

BlockLineComment
================

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+L'
Menu:   Block > Comment > Line

   Place line comments on each line of the block.  For a line block,
the comments will be inserted at the column of the left-most non-blank
character of the lines in the block; for a box block, the comments will
be inserted at the left edge of the block; this function is not
available for a stream block.

BlockLowerCase
==============

Key:    `Alt+.'
Menu:   Block > Conversions > Lower Case

   Convert every letter in the block to lower case.

BlockRightJustify
=================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+F9'
Menu:   Word > (Block Justify) Right

   Right justify the contents of the block.  For a line block, each
line is adjusted to end at the right margin; for a box block, text
within the block is moved to the right edge of the block; a stream
block will generate a warning.

BlockRot13
==========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+,'
Menu:   Block > Conversion > Rot13

   Rotate the English letters thirteen places.  This has the effect of
swapping `A'..`M' with `N'..`Z'.

BlockStripHiBit
===============

Key:    `Alt+/'
Menu:   Block > Conversions > Strip hi bit

   Zero the high (eighth) bit of all characters in the block.  This
function is useful when editing files created by WordStar.

BlockToFile
===========

Key:    `Alt+W'
Menu:   File > Special > Write Block

   Write the block to a file, using the current line ending (*note
ToggleCRLF::).

BlockTrimTrailing
=================

Key:    `Alt+T'
Menu:   Block > Trim Trail

   Remove all spaces from the end of each line in the block.  This
function is only available for line blocks.

BlockUnComment
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+E'
Menu:   Block > Comment > Remove

   Remove the comments (line or block, but not both) from the block.
The comments must be part of the block.  The first line of the block
must have a comment, but it is not necessary for every line to have one.

   For line comments, the comment will be removed from the beginning of
the line (or box), as well as the space after it, if one; a stream
block will only remove the comment from the first line of the stream.

   For block comments, the comments will be removed from the beginning
and end of a stream or the left and right edge of each line in a box.
A line block depends on the first line: if it has both start and end
comments, each line is tested; if the start and end comments are on
lines by themselves, those lines are deleted; otherwise it is assumed
to be like a stream, with the comment ending at the last line.

BlockUndent
===========

Key:    `Ctrl+K Ctrl+U'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Undent

   Perform a `BackSpace' or `BackTab' (depending on the indent mode) on
the first non-blank line of the block and carry that change throughout
the remaining lines.  A box block effectively treats the left edge as
the beginning of the line; this function is not available for a stream
block.

   If there are lines in the block that begin before the first line,
the initial characters will be deleted and the lines will be placed in
the undo buffer (*note RetrieveLine::).  Example:

       line1
     line2

Undenting these two lines would remove the two spaces from `line1', but
also the first two characters of `line2':

     line1
     ne2

BlockUndentN
============

Key:    `Ctrl+K U'
Menu:   Word > Indentation > Undent spaces

   Ask for a number and remove that many spaces from the beginning of
the block.  If the number is greater than the number of spaces on the
first non-blank line, use that number instead.  *Note BlockUndent::,
for a side-effect.

   This function is not available for a stream block.

BlockUpperCase
==============

Key:    `Alt+,'
Menu:   Block > Conversions > Upper Case

   Convert every letter in the block to upper case.

BorderBlock
===========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+B'
Menu:   Block > Border > Standard

   Draw a border/frame within the confines of a box block.  The
characters used to generate the border are configurable (press the
*Note Help:: key for how).  This function will always draw each corner
and side (use a space to "hide" one) using one character; *Note
BorderBlockEx::, for a multi-character border, with optional corners
and sides.

   The graphic characters (*note ToggleGraphicChars::) are
automatically turned on at the start of this function; once completed,
they are turned off again (if they were not already on).

BorderBlockEx
=============

Key:    `Ctrl+Alt+B'
Menu:   Block > Border > Enhanced

   Draw a border/frame within the confines of a box block.  Each corner
and side can be any number of characters, or none, in which case that
item is not drawn (although if there are no top or bottom items, the
left or right items will be drawn at the corners).

   The graphic characters (*note ToggleGraphicChars::) are
automatically turned on at the start of this function; once completed,
they are turned off again (if they were not already on).

BotOfScreen
===========

Key:    `Ctrl+PgDn'
Menu:   Move > Bottom line

   Move the cursor to the bottom line of the window.

BottomLine
==========

Key:    `Alt+End'
Menu:   Move > Line to bottom

   Move the current line and the cursor to the bottom line of the
window.

CenterJustify
=============

Key:    `Alt+F10'
Menu:   Word > (Justify) Center

   The current line is centered between the left and right margins.

CenterLine
==========

Key:    `Alt+End'
Menu:   Move > Line to center

   Move the current line and the cursor to the center line of the
window.

CenterWindow
============

Key:    `Center'
Menu:   Move > Center line

   Move the cursor to the center line of the window.

ChangeCurDir
============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+D'
Menu:   Toggles > Cursor direction

   Change the direction the cursor moves after typing a character or
backspace.  The direction can be selected by any of the arrow keys;
`Enter' will restore the normal direction.

   When the cursor is not updating the usual way, overwrite mode is
always on and the new direction is indicated in the mode line.
`BackSpace' will move in the opposite direction and overwrite the
character with a space.

CharacterSet
============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+H'
Menu:   Other > Character set

   Display the current character set.  The decimal code for each
character can be found by adding the number on the left to the number
on the top (add another ten for the second `0' to `5').

   Due to limitations in the UNIX console, not all characters will be
displayed on that system.

CharLeft
========

Key:    `Left'
Key:    `Ctrl+S'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor one character to the left; has no effect if the
cursor is already on the first column.

CharRight
=========

Key:    `Right'
Key:    `Ctrl+D'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor one character to the right; has no effect if the
cursor is on the 1040th column.

ClearAllMacros
==============

Key:    `Ctrl+Esc'
Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+M'
Menu:   Other > File > Clear

   Wipe all the macro definitions.  If the current window has syntax
highlighting only its language macros will be wiped; otherwise only the
global macros.

CloseWindow
===========

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F3'
Menu:   Window > Close

   This function has two uses, depending on when it used.  If used on a
zoomed (full-screen) window, it will close only that window (unlike
*Note Quit::, which will also close all hidden windows).  If used on a
split window, it will remove and hide the window, increasing the window
above or below, or left or right, and making it current.

ContextHelp
===========

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F1'
Menu:   Help > Context Help

   Loads a file into the editor (or switches to it if it is already
loaded) and, if the cursor is on a word, searches it for that word
(using a regular expression).  The default file is `tde.txt' and the
default expression is `^<~>' (where `~' is replaced with the word);
these can be changed in the configuration.  The file can have a
relative path, but if it exists when the editor is started, or once it
has been loaded, it will be made absolute.

CopyBlock
=========

Key:    `Alt+C'
Menu:   Block > Copy

   Copy the block to the cursor and then unmark the block.  For a line
block, the block will be copied to the line below the cursor; if the
cursor is inside the block, the block will be copied to the line after
the last line in the block.

CopyString
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+Enter'
Menu:   n/a

   Copy the string at the cursor in the current window to the prompt;
if the cursor is on a blank, do nothing.  It is an alias for
`BegNextLine', intended for use in macros.

CopyToClipboard
===============

Key:    `Ctrl+Insert'
Menu:   Block > Clipboard > Copy

   Copy the block to the Windows clipboard and then unmark the block.
It is only available for the 32-bit DOS (`tdep.exe') and Windows
(`tdew.exe') versions.

CopyWord
========

Key:    `Shift+Enter'
Menu:   n/a

   Copy the word (using the syntax highlighting definitions of a word)
at the cursor in the current window to the prompt; if the cursor is not
on a word, do nothing.  It is an alias for `NextLine', intended for use
in macros.

CutToClipboard
==============

Key:    `Shift+Delete'
Menu:   Block > Clipboard > Cut

   Copy the block to the Windows clipboard and then delete the block
(if the copy was successful).  It is only available for the 32-bit DOS
(`tdep.exe') and Windows (`tdew.exe') versions.

DateTimeStamp
=============

Key:    `Ctrl+2'
Menu:   Other > Date Stamp

   Insert (or overwrite) the current system time and/or date to the
cursor.  *Note StampFormat::, for how to configure the format.

DefineDiff
==========

Key:    `Shift+F11'
Menu:   Search > Begin Diff

   Start a "diff", the difference between two visible windows.  The
diff is capable of ignoring all space, or just leading space, on a
line; it can also ignore blank lines, and line endings (usually in
conjunction with ignore all space).  The case mode (*note
ToggleSearchCase::) determines if the diff will ignore or match case.

DefineGrep
==========

Key:    `Shift+F12'
Key:    `Ctrl+F12'
Key:    `Shift+Alt+Q'
Menu:   File > Grep > File Find

   Search a list of filenames and/or wildcards for a pattern.  If `RegX'
is checked, the pattern will be a regular expression; if unchecked,
straight text.  If `Results' is checked, all matching lines will be
copied to a new window, prefixed with the filename, line number and
column; otherwise it will load the first file that matches and position
the cursor at the match.  If `Load all' is checked, all matching files
will be loaded into the editor, positioned either at the first match
(`Results' unchecked), or at the beginning of the file (`Results'
checked).  If `Binary' is checked, files determined to be binary will
autoload using the last value of `-b' (*note Usage::); otherwise binary
files will be ignored.

   This function will also define the search string (*note
RepeatFindForward::, *note RepeatRegXForward::), but changing the
search string will not affect the grep.  *Note RepeatGrep::.

   *Note DirList::, for a description of wildcards.  Wildcards for this
function can also be used for directories and the special path `...'
will traverse subdirectories.  For example, `d*/.../*.c' will find all
the `.c' files in all the directories starting with `d' and all their
subdirectories.  The files will be sorted according to the current
directory list order.

DefineSearch
============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F5'
Menu:   Search > Search

   Start a search.  The pattern can be either plain text, or check
`RegX' for a regular expression.  To search the block it must be marked
in the current file.  The `All files' option will search across all
currently loaded files; it will ignore non-file (scratch) windows
(unless one happens to be current).  Since it is not possible to search
both the block and all files, checking one will uncheck the other.  The
`Results' option will create a new window containing all matching lines
of the search (prompting to continue if wrap occurred), prefixed by
filename, line number and column.  Generating results across all files
will always start the search from the beginning.  *Note RepeatSearch::.

DelBegOfLine
============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+-'
Menu:   Other > Delete begin

   Move the cursor to the first non-blank character, or the first
column, deleting everything in the way.

DelEndOfLine
============

Key:    `Alt+-'
Menu:   Other > Delete end

   Truncate the line at the cursor.

DeleteBlock
===========

Key:    `Alt+G'
Menu:   Block > Delete

   Delete the block.  The block does not have to be in the current file.

DeleteChar
==========

Key:    `Delete'
Key:    `Ctrl+G'
Menu:   n/a

   Delete the character under the cursor, shifting all remaining
characters back one.  This function will not join lines; *Note
StreamDeleteChar:: will do that.

DeleteLine
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+Y'
Key:    `Alt+D'
Menu:   Other > Delete

   Delete the current line, placing it in the undo buffer.  *Note
RetrieveLine::.

DirList
=======

Key:    `Alt+F1'
Menu:   File > Directory

   Select a subdirectory (or the current if none) and/or a wildcard
pattern and list the matching files and all subdirectories.  Select a
directory (placed first and indicated by a trailing slash (`/') to move
into it (provided it is not empty).  The parent directory can be
selected by the `../' entry, or by using `BackSpace'; another drive can
be selected by typing the drive letter, followed by a colon (`:'), or
vice versa (colon then letter).  The files can be sorted by filename or
extension by using the `SortBoxBlock' key (`Alt+S' by default).  Typing
a character will select each file that begins with that character;
additional characters (within half a second) will then narrow the
selection down.  A new path and/or pattern can be entered by pressing
`Tab'.

   The wildcards might be a bit more flexible than DOS/Windows users
are accustomed to.  The `*' character can be used anywhere (so `a*z'
matches all files that start with `a' and end in `z').  Brackets can be
used to match a character in a list (so `[aeiou]*' matches any file that
starts with a vowel).  If the list starts with `!' or `^' it matches
any character not in the list (so `[!aeiou]*' matches any file that does
_not_ start with a vowel).  The list may also contain a range --
`[a-z]' represents all lower case letters.  Multiple patterns can be
specified by separating with `;' (or `:' in UNIX), so `*.txt;*.doc'
will find all `.txt' and `.doc' files.  Exclusions can be achieved by
separating with `!', thus `!*.exe;*.com' will find everything _except_
`.exe' and `.com' files and `*.txt;*.doc!r*' will find all `.txt' and
`.doc' files, except those starting with `r'.  To find a literal `;' or
`!' place it inside a list.

   *Caution*: the extension dot is just a normal character, so `*.*'
will only match files that have an extension; to match all files only a
single `*' is required.  To match files without an extension use `!*.*'
(the DOS method of `*.' will not work).

DuplicateLine
=============

Key:    `Alt+='
Menu:   Other > Duplicate

   Make a copy of the current line and insert it below the cursor.

DynamicTabSize
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+Tab'
Menu:   Word > Tabs > Dynamic size

   Interactively choose the physical tab size, instantaneously changing
the display to reflect the new size.  `Left' or `Right' will change the
size by one, `Up' or `Down' will change by four.  Press `Enter' to
accept the new size, or `Esc' to restore the original.

EditFile
========

Key:    `Shift+F4'
Menu:   File > Load

   Prompt for a name and load the file into the editor.  If the name is
a subdirectory or contains wildcards then bring up the directory list
(*note DirList::); if the name is `=' the name of the current file will
be used.  The file will be made the current window, with the previous
window becoming hidden.

EditNextFile
============

Key:    `Alt+F4'
Menu:   File > Load Next

   The same as *Note EditFile::, but uses the next file (or next
matching file) on the command line, instead of prompting for a name.

EndNextLine
===========

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+Enter'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to the end of the next line.

EndOfFile
=========

Key:    `Ctrl+End'
Menu:   Move > End of File

   Move the cursor to the last page of the file (place EOF at the
bottom of the window, if possible); the cursor will remain at the same
screen position.

EndOfLine
=========

Key:    `End'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to the end of the line.

EraseBegOfLine
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+-'
Menu:   Other > Erase begin

   Fill the line with blanks, from the first column up to the cursor.

Execute
=======

Key:    `Shift+Alt+E'
Menu:   Other > Execute

   Run an external command.  The command can contain a number of
variables:

     `%f'    copy the current filename to the command, using a relative
             path
     `%F'    copy the current filename to the command, using the
             absolute path
     `%p'    prompt for a parameter for the command
     `%w'    copy the current word to the command
     `%W'    copy the current string to the command

   The filename will be automatically quoted if it contains a space or
any of the characters `+;,=%' and there is no quote (`"' or `'') before
it; insert an equal sign after the percent symbol to prevent that
(`%=f').  The function will fail if either `%f' or `%F' is used and the
current file is a scratch window.  If the cursor is not on a word or
string, it will prompt for one.

   There are also a few options:

     Capture output   capture the output of the command (`stderr' first,
                      followed by `stdout') into a new window (or
                      replace the current output) and make it the
                      current window; there is never a pause
     No echo          don't output the command
     No pause         return immediately, don't wait for a key
     Original files   don't save the files in the editor, use the
                      originals still on disk
     Reload files     reload modified files without prompting

   A blank command will run the shell, always with no echo and no
pause, but unlike *Note Shell::, files can be saved and automatically
reloaded.

File
====

Key:    `F4'
Menu:   Window > Close & Save

   Save the current file (*note Save::) then close the window (*note
Quit::).  If TDE has its output redirected, though, the block if one is
marked, otherwise the entire file, will be written to `stdout'.

FileAll
=======

Key:    `Ctrl+Q'
Menu:   File > Save and Exit

   Save all files then exit the editor (any files remaining on the
command line will not be loaded).  If any file could not be saved, all
files will remain open.

FileAttributes
==============

Key:    `Alt+F2'
Menu:   File > File attr

   Change the attributes (DOS/Windows) or permissions (UNIX) of a file.
The edit field takes precedence over the check boxes.  For UNIX, using
a string will apply the permissions to all groups; use the three-digit
octal number to set the groups independently.

FillBlock
=========

Key:    `Alt+F'
Menu:   Block > Fill > Character

   Completely fill the box block with a single character.

FillBlockDown
=============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F'
Menu:   Block > Fill > Down

   Duplicate the first row of the box block throughout the rest of the
block.

FillBlockPattern
================

Key:    `Ctrl+Alt+F'
Menu:   Block > Fill > Pattern

   Completely fill the box block with some text.  If the text is not
the same width as the block, it will be repeated and will wrap to
continue onto the next row.

FindBackward
============

Key:    `Shift+F6'
Menu:   Search > Find backward

   Start a text search, going backwards from the current cursor
position.  If it could not be found, the search will continue from the
end of the file.  *Note RepeatFindBackward::.

FindForward
===========

Key:    `Shift+F5'
Menu:   Search > Find forward

   Start a text search, going forwards from the current cursor
position.  If it could not be found, the search will continue from the
start of the file.  *Note RepeatFindForward::.

FormatParagraph
===============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+B'
Menu:   Word > Format Paragraph

   Format the current paragraph (a group of lines between blank lines)
according to the current margins.

FormatText
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+B'
Menu:   Word > Format forward

   Format the text from the current line to the first blank line,
according to the current margins.

GotoMark<N>
===========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+<N>'
Key:    `Ctrl+K <N>' (UNIX)
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to a previously defined position.  There are three
markers available, so replace `<N>' with `1', `2', or `3'.  The markers
are local to each file.

GotoWindow
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F11'
Menu:   Window > Goto

   Select a window by number and letter, or filename.  If the string
starts with a digit, it is assumed to be the file number; if there is
no following letter, find the first (visible) window.  If the string
does not start with a digit, it is assumed to be the start of the
filename (the name itself, not the path).  If no window is chosen (i.e.
an empty string) a window list is displayed.  This is similar to the
directory list (*note DirList::).  This list uses symbols to indicate
the type of window.  The first symbol is `!' for the current window,
`-' for a hidden window and `+' for a visible window.  Then comes the
window number and letter and the three file indicators: `!' for
read-only, `#' for scratch and `*' for modified.  The window title or
relative file name is last, which also determines the sorting.  Typing
a number will select that window number; typing anything else will
select the name.

Help
====

Key:    `F1'
Key:    `Ctrl+J'
Key:    `Alt+H'
Menu:   n/a

   Display a help screen.  The screen can be customised by creating a
`tde.hlp' file (DOS/Windows) or `.tdehlp' file (UNIX).  It will be
loaded from the current directory, the directory contained in the
`TDEHOME' or `HOME' environment variables, or the same directory as the
executable, whichever exists first.  The file can contain two help
screens: one for the normal editor and one for a read-only file; use a
`<<<>>>' sequence to separate the two.  The screens can be a maximum of
50 lines, with each line having a maximum of 100 characters.

InsertFile
==========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+Insert'
Menu:   File > Special > Insert File

   Insert another file into the current file, below the current line.
If the current file is binary, the inserted file will _not_
automatically be loaded as binary.

ISearchBackward
===============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+R'
Menu:   Search > ISearch <

   Start a backward incremental (interactive) search.  *Note
ISearchForward::.

ISearchForward
==============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+S'
Menu:   Search > ISearch >

   Incremental (or interactive) searching finds the search string as it
is typed in.  TDE's isearch is based on Emacs.  The default keys are
`Shift+Ctrl+S' for forward searching and `Shift+Ctrl+R' for backward;
however, within isearch, `Ctrl+S' and `Ctrl+R' can be used.  Pressing
these keys again will immediately start a search with the previous find
string (not necessarily isearch); otherwise they will continue the
search with the current string.  `LineUp' and `LineDown' will cycle
through the find history.  `BackSpace' can be used to remove entered
characters, returning to the previous position.  `CopyWord',
`WordRight', `WordEndRight' and `Ctrl+W' will append the remainder of
the word to the search string; likewise with the `String' functions and
`Shift+Ctrl+W'.  If no search string has been entered, the complete
word or string will be copied.  `ToggleSearchCase' will do the obvious.
`Esc' will stop the search at the current position; `AbortCommand' and
`Ctrl+G' will restore the original position before the search was
started.  `Enter'/`Rturn' will stop the search when entering characters
or using the ISearch functions to continue it; otherwise the search
will be continued.  The previous position is set to the original
position, not to the last matching instance; if aborted, it is set to
the aborted position.

JoinLine
========

Key:    `Alt+J'
Menu:   Other > Join

   Join the next line with the current, at the cursor position (any
text after the cursor is deleted).

JumpToPosition
==============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+J'
Menu:   Move > Goto Position

   Jump to a line number and/or column, or a binary offset.  A negative
line number will be taken from the end of the file (`-1' is the last
line); a negative column from the end of the line (`0' is EOL, `-1' is
the last character).  The offset always uses a binary line ending, even
if the file is not.  It can be specified in hexadecimal by prefixing
with `0x' (thus `1024' and `0x400' are the same position).

KopyBlock
=========

Key:    `Alt+K'
Menu:   Block > Kopy

   Like *Note CopyBlock::, but the block remains marked.

page up one line.

LoadMacro
=========

Key:    `Shift+F3'
Menu:   Other > File > Load

   Load macro definitions from a file.  If the current window has syntax
highlighting the macros will be local to that language.  The file can
also contain any other configuration information, not just macros.

Macro
=====

Key:    n/a
Menu:   n/a

   A configuration setting used to define a macro -- a group of
functions assigned to one key.  Please see the `config/tde.cfg' file
for details.

MacroMark
=========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+M'
Key:    `Ctrl+K M' (UNIX)

window.

MakeVertical
============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F8'
Menu:   Window > Make vertical

   Select a function to create a new window in the right of the current
window.  The current column will become the vertical separator.

MarkBegin
=========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+['
Key:    `Ctrl+K B' (UNIX)
Menu:   n/a

   Set the beginning of the block; if no block is marked, create a box
block.  If the beginning is after the end, the positions will be
swapped.

MarkBox
=======

Key:    `Alt+B'
Menu:   n/a

   Mark a box block, either the beginning corner or the ending corner,
depending on the relative position of the cursor.

   The first press will mark one character; if used again immediately,
it will mark the current word; then the string; and finally the
paragraph.

MarkEnd
=======

Key:    `Shift+Alt+]'
Key:    `Ctrl+K K' (UNIX)
Menu:   n/a

   Set the end of the block; if no block is marked, create a box block.

MarkLine
========

Key:    `Alt+L'
Menu:   n/a

   Mark a line block, either the beginning line or the ending line,
depending on the relative position of the cursor.  If a stream block
(*note MarkStream:: is already defined, this function will mark the
entire line, leaving the block as a stream; however, once the beginning
line has been defined this way, defining it again will turn the block
into a line block.

   The first press will mark one line; if used again immediately, it
will mark a region of equal or greater indentation, or a group of blank
lines; then the top and bottom lines will be extended by one line;
finally, it will mark the entire paragraph.

MarkStream
==========

Key:    `Alt+X'
Menu:   n/a

   Mark a stream block, either the beginning line/column or the ending,
depending on the relative position of the cursor.  A stream block is
like a line block, except it can start or end anywhere within a line.
Use *Note MarkLine:: to mark the last line as a complete line.

   The first press will mark one character; if used again immediately,
it will mark the line (without the leading or trailing blanks); and
then it will mark the paragraph (likewise).

MoveBlock
=========

Key:    `Alt+M'
Menu:   Block > Move

   Move the block to the cursor; a line block will be moved to the line
below the cursor.  The block is then unmarked.

MoveMark
========

Key:    `Ctrl+Alt+['
Menu:   Block > Move

   Move the block mark to the cursor.  For a stream block, the cursor
will become the new start column, but the ending column will remain
unchanged.

NextBrowse
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F7'
Menu:   Move > Next Browse

   Move the cursor to the position given in the next line of the
current browser window.  If the last line has been reached, go back to
the first.

   The current window will become the current browser window if it is a
results (*note DefineSearch::, *note DefineGrep::) or output (*note
Execute::) window.  If there is no browser window, find the first
results or output window after the current; the first before the
current; or the current window if it is scratch.  If the current window
becomes the current browser window, the current line will be used,
rather than the next.

   A line will be recognised as a browser line if it contains nothing
but a filename, or a filename with at least one number.  The first
number will assumed to be a line number; if there is another number, it
will assumed to be a column.  Each item can be separated by a space,
tab, colon, semicolon or comma.  Only the first four such items will be
tested for a filename.

NextDirtyLine
=============

Key:    `Alt+F5'
Menu:   Move > Next Dirty Line

key, allowing it to be defined as a macro within the editor.

NumberBlock
===========

Key:    `Alt+N'
Menu:   Block > Number

   Place a number in each row of the box block, filling the remainder
with either a space or a zero.  Only integers are supported, although
decimals can be created by filling a column with the point and
filling/numbering to the left and right of it.  The number and
increment are given in the base shown (which is always decimal); valid
bases are from 2 to 36, with only 10 being signed.

OverlayBlock
============

Key:    `Alt+O'

`config/tde.cfg' file for details.

PopupRuler
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+='
Menu:   Other > Popup Ruler

   Creates a ruler at the current cursor position, which can be moved
around the screen.  If the line number display is on (*note
ToggleLineNumbers::) it will be used to count lines; if it is off, it
can be turned on, but it can't be turned off.

   The arrow keys will move the ruler; in conjunction with `Ctrl' the
window will move (with the ruler maintaining its position in the file).
`StartOfLine' will move the ruler to the first column.  `Home' will
move the window to the first column; `End' will move the window to the
end of the longest line currently visible.
`(Half)ScreenUp/Down/Left/Right' and `Top/EndOfFile' will move the
window appropriately.  `Esc' will remove the ruler and restore the
original window position.

PrevBrowse
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F8'
Menu:   Move > Prev Browse

function will restore that position (and remember where _it_ came from).

PreviousWindow
==============

Key:    `Shift+F10'
Menu:   Window > Previous

   Select the previous visible window.

PrintBlock
==========

PseudoMacro
===========

Key:    `Alt+Enter'
Key:    `Ctrl+Space'
Menu:   Macro > Pseudo-macro

   A pseudo-macro is identical to a macro, except in the way it's
started.  Where a normal macro is assigned to a key, a pseudo-macro is
assigned to a "trigger".  The trigger is the two characters before the
cursor.  Please see the `config/tde.cfg' file for details.

PullDown
========

Key:    `Ctrl+\'
Menu:   n/a

   Bring up a pop-up pull-down menu, containing most of the editor
functions.  Even though it is not displayed, the headings can be
selected by number (the left-most is `1').  The menu and the names
given to the keys are configurable -- see `config/menu.cfg' and the end
of `config/tde.cfg' for usage.

Key:    `F3'
Key:    `Alt+Q'
Key:    `Ctrl+K Q' (UNIX)
Menu:   Window > Close

   Close the current window, prompting to abandon changes.  If it is the
last window, the next file on the command line will be opened, or the
editor will exit if none.  If there are multiple windows or files, then
if there is a hidden window, it becomes the current; otherwise the
window above or below, or to the left or right, will grow to accomodate
the closed window; if this is not possible, the window will not be
closed.

QuitAll
=======

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+Q'
Menu:   File > Exit

RecordMacro
===========

Key:    `Alt+F3'
Menu:   Other > Record/Stop

   Record a macro -- a series of functions and characters that can be
played back with a single key.  This function serves to both start the
recording and then stop it.  The recording will also stop when the
assigned key is pressed -- this is a recursive macro, that will
continue to execute until an error condition occurs (typically hitting
the end of the file).  If the *Note PseudoMacro:: key is used for the
assignment, a pseudo-macro will be recorded using the two characters to
the left of the cursor as the trigger.

   Most prompts will be stored with the macro, but certain critical
choices will not, for example: `Overwrite existing file (y/n)?'.

RegXForward
===========

Key:    `Shift+F7'
Menu:   Search > Regx forward

   Start a regular expression search, going forwards from the current
cursor position.  If it could not be found, the search will continue
from the start of the file.  *Note RepeatRegXForward::.

Repeat
======

Key:    `Shift+Alt+R'
Menu:   Other > Repeat

   Repeat a key a certain number of times.  If the repeat value is `0',
the key will be repeated until an error condition occurs or the break
point (*note SetBreakPoint::) is reached; if the value is negative, it
is taken as a line number and the count is the difference from the
current line.

RepeatDiff

Key:    `F12'
Menu:   File > Grep > Next File

   Find the next file that contains the pattern (either text or regular
expression, depending on the defining function).  *Note DefineGrep::.

RepeatRegXBackward
==================

Key:    `Alt+F7'
Menu:   Search > Repeat <

   Find the previous occurrence of the regular expression search
pattern.  If it could not be found, the search will continue from the
end of the file.  If no pattern has been defined, ask for it.

instead.

ReplaceString
=============

Key:    `Shift+F8'
Menu:   Search > Replace

   Search for a string and replace it with another (or possibly
nothing), or search for a regular expression and manipulate matching
portions of it (press *Note Help:: to see how).  To search the block it
must be marked in the current file.  Checking `All files' will perform
the replace across all currently loaded files; non-file (scratch)
windows will be ignored.

RestoreLine
===========

Key:    `Esc'
Menu:   Other > Undo/redo

   Changes to a line are made in an internal buffer -- the original
line remains until the changes need to be committed (such as moving off
the line).  This function will swap the modified line with the original
line, thus undoing the changes, but also allowing them to be restored
in turn.

RetrieveLine
============

Key:    `Alt+Y'
Key:    `Ctrl+U'
Menu:   Other > Retrieve

   Recover a previously deleted line.  The line is placed above the

Key:    `GreyEnter'
Key:    `Ctrl+M'
Menu:   n/a

   Insert a new line below the current line and move to it.  If the
cursor is within the line, the line will be split at that position.  In
indent or dynamic word wrap modes, the new line will line up with the
current line's indentation; in fixed wrap mode, with the paragraph or
left margin.  If the file is binary, this function will only move to
the next line, not insert a line.

   `Enter' is usually temporarily remapped to this function when
performing other functions.

   The same as *Note Save::, but it preserves the original file's
timestamp.

SaveWorkspace
=============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+W'
Menu:   File > Save Workspace

   Save the current workspace, prompting for a filename.  The workspace
includes all windows (which includes cursor position), files (which
includes block and markers) and the prompt histories.  It does not save
the editor settings.

ScratchWindow
=============

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+F4'
Menu:   File > Scratch

   Create a scratch window, making it the current window.  A scratch
window is one that does not prompt to abandon changes; it is indicated
by a `#' in the window header.

ScreenDown
==========

Key:    `PgDn'
Key:    `Ctrl+C'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the file down one page.  There is one line of overlap (the
bottom line will become the top line).

ScreenLeft
==========

Key:    `Alt+PgUp'
Menu:   Move > Window left

   Move the file left one page.  There is one column of overlap only if
the show long lines mode is on (*note ToggleEOL::).

ScreenRight
===========

Key:    `Alt+PgDn'
Menu:   Move > Window right

   Move the file right one page.  There is one column of overlap only
if the show long lines mode is on (*note ToggleEOL::).

ScreenUp
========

Key:    `PgUp'
Key:    `Ctrl+R'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the file up one page.  There is one line of overlap (the top
line will become the bottom line).

ScrollDnLine
============

Key:    `Ctrl+Down'
Key:    `Ctrl+Z'
Key:    `Grey+'
Menu:   n/a

   Scroll the file up one line, moving the cursor with it.

SetBreakPoint
=============

Key:    `Shift+Esc'
Menu:   Toggles > Break point

   Set or clear the break point.  The break point is used to stop
recursive macros or infinitely repeated keys.  It only works on exactly
the line of the break point, not before or after it.

SetDirectory
============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+='
Menu:   File > Set directory

   Set the current directory to the same path as the current file.

SetMargins
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F6'
Menu:   Word > Margins

   Set the columns of the left, right and paragraph margins, and
whether the right margin should be justified.  All columns must be
greater than zero; the left and paragraph margins must be less than the
right margin; the right margin must be less than the maximum line
length.  The paragraph margin can be less than the left margin, to
produce a hanging indent.

SetMark<N>
==========

Key:    `Alt+<N>'
Key:    `Ctrl+K Shift+<N>' (UNIX)
Menu:   n/a

   Remember the current position.  There are three markers available,
so replace `<N>' with `1', `2', or `3'.

SetTabs
=======

Key:    `Ctrl+Tab'
Menu:   Word > Tabs > Set tabs

   Set the logical and physical tab sizes.  The logical tab size
determines the number of spaces used when the tab key is pressed (in
fixed tab mode); the physical tab size determines the number of spaces
used by the actual tab character.  For example, setting logical tab
size to `4', but physical tab size to `8', would mean `Tab' would have
to be pressed twice to generate one tab character.

Shell
=====

Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+P'
Menu:   Other > Shell

   Temporarily leave the editor by running the system's shell program.
Type `exit' to return to TDE.  *Caution*: TDE will not recognise screen
size changes made during the shell, so any changes made should be
restored prior to returning to TDE.  (No harm will result in returning
with a different size, but nothing will display correctly.)

SizeWindow
==========

Key:    `Shift+F9'
Menu:   Window > Size

   Size the current window (and any related windows).  It will usually
change the top and/or left edges, but a top- and/or left-most window
will change the bottom and/or right edges.

SortBoxBlock
============

Key:    `Alt+S'
Menu:   Block > Sort

   Sort the lines in the block, prompting to sort ascending or
descending.  If a line block is marked, the entire line acts as the
key; a box block will use the contents of the block as the key; this
function is not available for a stream block.  To sort multiple
columns, sort the least significant column first.  The case mode (*note
ToggleSearchCase::) controls the case sensitivity of the sort.

SplitHalfHorizontal
===================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+F12'
Menu:   Window > Split half horiz.

   Split the current window in half, creating two views of the one
file.  The new window will be the bottom half of the current window and
will then become the current window.

SplitHalfVertical
=================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+F11'
Menu:   Window > Split half vert.

   Split the current window in half, creating two views of the one
file.  The new window will be the right half of the current window and
will then become the current window.

SplitHorizontal
===============

Key:    `F9'
Menu:   Window > Split horizontal

   Split the current window at the cursor, creating two views of the
one file.  The current line will become the header of the new window.

SplitLine
=========

Key:    `Ctrl+-'
Menu:   Other > Split

   Split the current line at the cursor.  If indent or dynamic word
wrap mode is on, the new line will match the indentation of the
current; if fixed wrap, the line will start at the left margin.

SplitVertical
=============

Key:    `F8'
Menu:   Window > Split vertical

   Split the current window at the cursor, creating two views of the
one file.  The current column will become the vertical separator
between the windows.

StampFormat
===========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+F'
Menu:   Stamp Format

   Set the format for how the time will be displayed (*note
DateTimeStamp::).  The default format can be configured -- please see
`config/tde.cfg'.

StartOfLine
===========

Key:    `Shift+Home'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to column 1.

Statistics
==========

Key:    `Shift+GreyEnter'
Menu:   File > Statistics

   Display certain statistics about the current file, such as the
number of lines, words and strings, the size of the file on disk (using
the current line ending format) and the amount of memory the file uses
(including windows and syntax highlighting).

Status
======

Key:    `Ctrl+GreyEnter'
Menu:   File > Status

   Display the status of the current file, such as where and what type
of block is marked and where the markers are located.

StreamCharLeft
==============

Key:    `Shift+Left'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor one character to the left; if the cursor is on the
first column, move to the end of the previous line.

StreamCharRight
===============

Key:    `Shift+Right'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor one character to the right; if the cursor is at (or
beyond) the end of the line, move to the first column of the next line.

StreamDeleteChar
================

Key:    `Ctrl+Delete'
Menu:   n/a

   Delete the character under the cursor, shifting all remaining
characters back one; if the cursor is at (or beyond) the end of the
line, join the next line with the current.

StringEndLeft
=============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+;'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to the end of the previous string.

StringEndRight
==============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+''
Menu:   n/a

SumBlock
========

Key:    `Alt+Grey+'
Menu:   Block > Sum

   Sum the numbers in a box block.  The numbers are treated as signed
decimal.  If the cursor is at TOF or EOF, or if the file is read-only,
the sum will be displayed in a message; otherwise it will be inserted
(or overwritten) into the file.

SwapBlock
=========

Key:    `Shift+Alt+S'
Menu:   Block > Swap

   Mark another region in the file and swap it with the block.  This
function is not available for a stream block.

   Swapping a box block has two separate operations, depending on the
size of the block and the location of the cursor.  If the cursor is
above the block, within range of the number of lines in the block (i.e.
if the block was at the cursor, it would overlap itself) then the rows
of the block will swap with the rows of the swap region (the width
remains the same).  In any other case, the swap region will have the
same number of rows, allowing a different number of columns to be
swapped.

   The swap region can be sized by using the arrow keys; in conjunction
with `Ctrl' the swap will be made the same size as the block.  `Home'
will move to the first line or column of the swap and `End' to the last.
`Enter' will accept the swap, `Esc' will cancel it.

SyntaxSelect
============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+L'
Menu:   File > Select Language

   Select the language to be used for syntax highlighting.  If the same
language is chosen it will be re-read from file.  If no language is
chosen (i.e. an empty string) a list of all languages will be
displayed.  This is similar to the directory list (*note DirList::).
It displays the selected language, with its parent language in
brackets, if present; a semicolon- (DOS, Win32) or colon- (UNIX)
separated list of patterns; and how the language treats case (`inherit'
indicates the parent language determines case).  Sometimes you may see
duplicated languages; this is due to the language being defined both
locally and globally.

Tab
===

Key:    `Tab'
Key:    `Ctrl+I'
Menu:   n/a

   Move the cursor to the next tab stop and, in insert mode, insert
spaces.  *Note ToggleSmartTabs::, for how tab stops are determined.

TitleWindow
===========

Key:    `Ctrl+`'
Menu:   Window > Title

   Use something other than the file name to identify the window.  The
default name is the complete path, which won't be split like it usually
is (i.e. as `name - path').

ToggleCRLF
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F3'
Menu:   Toggles > Line ending

   Change the line ending used when writing the file.  It alternates
between `crlf' (native DOS and Windows), `lf' (native UNIX) and `BIN'
(no line ending).

ToggleCursorCross
=================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+X'
Menu:   Toggles > Cursor cross

   Turn the cursor cross on or off.  The cross is horizontal and
vertical lines intersecting at the cursor.

ToggleCWD
=========

ToggleDraw
==========

Key:    `Alt+Insert'
Menu:   Toggles > Drawing

   Turn drawing mode on or off.  In drawing mode, the
`(Stream)CharLeft/Right' and `LineUp/Down' functions will draw a line
(or corner or intersection, as appropriate) using the current graphic
set (*note ToggleGraphicChars::).  Turning on draw mode will
automatically turn on the graphic characters.

ToggleEOL
=========

Key:    `Ctrl+F2'
Menu:   Toggles > EOL display

   Indicate whether a special character should be displayed at the end
of each line (and also display tab characters), or at the end of the
window if the line is longer, or if nothing should be displayed
(default).

ToggleGraphicChars
==================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+G'
Menu:   Toggles > Graphic characters

   Turn graphic characters on or off.  When using graphic characters,
the numbers and minus are translated to drawing characters, with the
function keys controlling the type:

     `F1'      single line
     `F2'      double line
     `F3'      single horizontal, double vertical
     `F4'      double horizontal, single vertical
     `F5'      solid
     `F6'      ASCII

   Imagine a grid overlaid the numbers of the keypad to see how they are
translated, with `0' as the vertical line and `-' as the horizontal.
Solid mode is slightly different, though (for codepage 437):

     `0'       light shade
     `1'       medium shade
     `2'       lower half block
     `3'       heavy shade
     `4'       right half block
     `5'       full block
     `6'       left half block
     `7'       left-pointing double angle quotation mark
     `8'       upper half block
     `9'       right-pointing double angle quotation mark
     `-'       black square

ToggleIndent
============

`tdew.exe'.

ToggleReadOnly
==============

Key:    `Alt+\'
Menu:   Toggles > Read only

   Allow the file to be edited or not.  If the file is read only an `!'
is displayed in the window's header.  A read only file also allows keys
usually used as characters to be used as functions.

ToggleRuler
===========

Key:    `Alt+R'
Menu:   Toggles > Ruler

   Turn the ruler on or off.  The ruler is displayed at the top of each
window, indicating the current cursor position and the margins.

ToggleSearchCase
================

Key:    `Ctrl+F5'
Menu:   Search > Toggle Case

   Alternate the search case between ignoring and matching.  This
option also applies to diffing (*note DefineDiff::) and sorting (*note
SortBoxBlock::).

ToggleSmartTabs
===============

Key:    `Alt+Tab'
Key:    `Shift+Ctrl+I'
Menu:   Word > Tabs > Smart tabs

   Alternate between fixed tabs and smart tabs.  Fixed tabs use the
logical tab size to determine the next (or previous) tab stop; smart
tabs use the next (or previous) string in the previous non-blank line.

ToggleSync
==========

Key:    `Ctrl+F1'
Menu:   Move > Cursor sync

   Turn cursor synchronisation on or off.  With sync on, most movement

ToggleTabInflate
================

Key:    `Shift+Alt+T'
Menu:   Word > Tabs > Inflate tabs

   Select one of three tab modes: deflate tabs treats tabs as normal
characters; inflate tabs expands tabs to spaces when editing, then
compresses spaces to tabs when done; real tabs edits with the tab
characters, when possible.  Spaces are not compressed after a quote
character (either `"' or `'').  The tab mode is separate for each file.

ToggleTrailing
==============

Key:    `Ctrl+F4'
Menu:   Toggles > Trim trailing

   Turn trim trailing on or off.  When on, any trailing space at the
end of the line will be removed.  This only applies to the line being
edited; trailing space is not removed when a file is loaded or saved,
*Note BlockTrimTrailing::, to do that.

ToggleUndoGroup
===============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+U'
Menu:   Toggles > Group undo

   Alternate between individual or group undo.  In group undo, every
instance of a repeated function is undone in one go.

ToggleUndoMove
==============

Key:    `Shift+Alt+Y'
Menu:   Toggles > Undo movement

   Determine if movement should be undone.  If movement is not undone,
`Undo' will move to the position being undone, before actually undoing.

ToggleWordWrap
==============

Key:    `Alt+V'
Menu:   Toggles > Word wrap

   Word wrap will move words to the next line if they exceed the right
margin.  There are two methods: fixed wrap will move the word to the
left margin; dynamic wrap will align with the previous line's
indentation.

ToggleZ
=======

Key:    `Alt+Z'
Menu:   Toggles > Control Z

   Resize the current window to the maximum possible, hiding all other
visible windows.

Dialogs & Prompts
*****************

Dialogs
=======

Dialogs in TDE are quite simple, consisting only of edit fields and
check boxes.  Use `Tab'/`PgDn' and `Shift+Tab'/`PgUp' to switch between
edit fields and the function keys to toggle check boxes; `GotoMark<N>'
will move to the <N>th edit field.  To accept the values press `Enter';
`Esc' will cancel the dialog.  Cancelling a dialog will _not_
necessarily restore the original values (for example, turning on `RegX'
in `DefineSearch', then cancelling, will still leave the `RegX' option
on the next time).

   When a dialog is opened from a macro (either recording or playing),
all the check boxes will be cleared and the focus will be set to the
first edit field (however, a macro definition can include the flag
`UsesDialog' to prevent this).

Prompts
=======

Prompts (and edit fields) can be edited in much the same way as any
text in the editor.  If the first key is a character, `DeleteChar' or
`StreamDeleteChar', the initial answer will be erased.  The following
functions have the same meaning as their main editor counterpart:

     `BackSpace'          `EndOfLine'                 `Transpose'
     `BegOfLine'          `SetDirectory'              `WordDelete'
     `CharLeft'           `StreamCharLeft'            `WordDeleteBack'
     `CharRight'          `StreamCharRight'           `WordLeft'
     `DelBegOfLine'       `StreamDeleteChar'          `WordRight'
     `DelEndOfLine'       `ToggleOverWrite'           
     `DeleteChar'         `ToggleSearchCase'          

The following functions are also available:

     `AbortCommand'        cancel the prompt, keep original answer
     `BackTab'             filename completion
     `BegNextLine'         copy the string from the current window
     `CopyToClipboard'     copy the answer to the clipboard
     `CutToClipboard'      copy the answer to the clipboard
     `DeleteLine'          erase the answer, but add it to the history
     `Help'                display help for the command, if any
     `KopyToClipboard'     copy the answer to the clipboard
     `LineDown'            retrieve the next answer from the history
     `LineUp'              retrieve the previous answer from the history
     `NextLine'            copy the word from the current window
     `PasteFromClipboard'  copy the first line from the clipboard
     `Rturn'               accept the answer and add it to the history
     `ScrollDnLine'        complete next entry from the history
     `ScrollUpLine'        complete previous entry from the history
     `Tab'                 filename completion
     `ToggleCWD'           if the `DisplayCWD' option is off, display
                           the current directory above the prompt, or at
                           the bottom of the screen in a dialog

   The clipboard functions are only available to `tdep.exe' and
`tdew.exe'.

   Copying the word or string from the current window, or the line from
the clipboard, will use the insert or overwrite mode.  If it is the
first key pressed, the current answer will be erased.

   Filename completion is only available to functions that expect a
filename.  If the answer contains wildcard characters, each matching
filename will become the answer.  If there are no wildcards, the entire
answer will form the prefix of a filename.  The first completion will
add the characters common to all matching files; each subsequent
completion will be the filename itself.  Once all names have been
displayed, the common characters will again be shown.

   History completion will search the history for a line that matches
the answer up to the current cursor position.  The search mode case
will be used.

   Prompts that expect a filename (more specifically, any prompt that
uses the file history) will recognise a leading `~/' and substitute it
for TDE's home directory (`TDEHOME', `HOME' or the same path as the
executable).

Issues
******

Most users should have no problem running TDE, but there a few
situations that cause troubles.

TDEW & TZ
     If you need to use the `TZ' environment variable, include the
     abbreviation, otherwise the current time will be wrong.  Eg: use
     `set TZ=EST-10', not `set TZ=-10'.

TDEP & DR-DOS
     The built-in DPMI server needs to be used, otherwise the keyboard
     will not function correctly.

Cygwin/MSYS
     TDE will not run correctly in the shells of these environments.
     Use `start' to run TDE in a new console window.
